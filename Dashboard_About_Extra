### Other

The application is built with the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) framework for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). The application layout is produced with the [flexdashboard](http://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/index.html) package, and the charts and maps use [Plotly](http://plot.ly), accessed through its corresponding R packages.  

Code for the application is available at <https://github.com/sparklingjourney/COVID-Mobility-Dashboard>.
